Modular Estimator
=============================================


Welcome to the documentation for the modest package; a modular estimation library for Python.  The goal of modest is to make it as easy as possible to implement estimation algorithms with minimum amounts of re-written boiler plate material.

Please note that this package is very much in an "alpha" development status: there are large portions of the code which need testing and documentation.
